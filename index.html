                    Artificial intelligence (AI) can be said the ability of a computer or a computer-controlled robot to accomplish tasks that only intelligent beings can normally perform. This phrase is generally used to refer to a project that aims to create systems with human-like cognitive abilities, such as the ability to reason, discern meaning, making disicions, and learn from past experiences. Since the invention of computer in the 1940s, it has been proved that computers can be programmed in such a way that it can perform extremely complicated jobs with ease, such as finding proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess. Despite ongoing increases in computer processing speed and memory capacity, no computer programs have yet to equal human standard of flexibility across broader areas or in activities requiring a great deal of common sense. On the other hand, certain AI have surpassed the performance levels of human specialists and professionals in executing Various jobs. As a result, applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition use artificial intelligence.

                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>
                    The history of AI began many centurys ago with myths and stories, about beings artificially created and endowed with intelligence and 
                    consciousness by Sorcerer. The seeds of modernized AI were sown by philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking with
                    mechanical manipulation of signs and symbols. This concept culminated in the 1940s via the invention of a programmable digital computer, a machine based on the  
                    abstract essence of mathematical thinking. This device and the concepts behind it inspired a few scientists to seriously ponder about the potential to 
                    build an electronic brain.<br>
                    
                    In the summer of 1956 at a workshop on Dartmouth Campus in United States a research was done in the field of AI. The research team predicted that an AI
                    as intelligent as human would exist within a century. Millions of dollars were invested in this project.<br>
                    
                    As time went on, Researchers realized that they have underestimated the difficulty of this project. In 1973, faced with criticism and pressure from congress
                    The US and the British government had to stop their funding to the research of AI bringing the dark age for AI also known as the "AI Winter". Only after
                    seven years of effort from visionary philosopher of Japan, were the governments finally inspired to refund in AI development with billions of dollars as
                    an investment, but this didnt continue for long as the investors were dillusioned with lack of any improvements.<br>
                    
                    Finally at the begining of the 21st era with the successful application of machine learning to solve various problems in the field of science and industry
                    with the help of powerful computer hardware,and ability to store vast amount of data, Intreast and investments on AI skyrocketed.<br>
