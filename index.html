                    Artificial intelligence (AI) can be said the ability of a computer or a computer-controlled robot to accomplish tasks that only intelligent beings can normally perform. This phrase is generally used to refer to a project that aims to create systems with human-like cognitive abilities, such as the ability to reason, discern meaning, making disicions, and learn from past experiences. Since the invention of computer in the 1940s, it has been proved that computers can be programmed in such a way that it can perform extremely complicated jobs with ease, such as finding proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess. Despite ongoing increases in computer processing speed and memory capacity, no computer programs have yet to equal human standard of flexibility across broader areas or in activities requiring a great deal of common sense. On the other hand, certain AI have surpassed the performance levels of human specialists and professionals in executing Various jobs. As a result, applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition use artificial intelligence.

                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>
                    The history of AI began many centurys ago with myths and stories, about beings artificially created and endowed with intelligence and 
                    consciousness by Sorcerer. The seeds of modernized AI were sown by philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking with
                    mechanical manipulation of signs and symbols. This concept culminated in the 1940s via the invention of a programmable digital computer, a machine based on the  
                    abstract essence of mathematical thinking. This device and the concepts behind it inspired a few scientists to seriously ponder about the potential to 
                    build an electronic brain.<br>
                    
                    In the summer of 1956 at a workshop on Dartmouth Campus in United States a research was done in the field of AI. The research team predicted that an AI
                    as intelligent as human would exist within a century. Millions of dollars were invested in this project.<br>
                    
                    As time went on, Researchers realized that they have underestimated the difficulty of this project. In 1973, faced with criticism and pressure from congress
                    The US and the British government had to stop their funding to the research of AI bringing the dark age for AI also known as the "AI Winter". Only after
                    seven years of effort from visionary philosopher of Japan, were the governments finally inspired to refund in AI development with billions of dollars as
                    an investment, but this didnt continue for long as the investors were dillusioned with lack of any improvements.<br>
                    
                    Finally at the begining of the 21st era with the successful application of machine learning to solve various problems in the field of science and industry
                    with the help of powerful computer hardware,and ability to store vast amount of data, Intreast and investments on AI skyrocketed.<br>

                    <p>
                        Similar to humans, computer programs also learn in different manners. Talking of AI, learning by this platform is further segregated into a varied number of forms. One of the essential components of ai, learning for AI includes the trial-and-error method. The solution keeps on solving problems until it comes across the right results. This way, the program keeps a note of all the moves that gave positive results and stores it in its database to use the next time the computer is given the same problem.<br>
                        The learning component of AI includes memorizing individual items like different solutions to problems, vocabulary, foreign languages, etc., also known as rote learning. This learning method is later implemented using the generalization method.

                <div class='Reasoning'>
                    <h1>Components : Reasoning</h1>
                    <p>
                        The art of reasoning was something that was only limited to humans until five decades ago. The ability to differentiate makes Reasoning one of the essential components of artificial intelligence. To reason is to allow the platform to draw inferences that fit with the provided situation. Further, these inferences are also categorized as either inductive or deductive. The difference is that in an inferential case, the solution of a problem provides guarantees of conclusion. In contrast, in the inductive case, the accident is always a result of instrument failure.<br>
                        The use of deductive interferences by programming computers has provided them with considerable success. However, reasoning always involves drawing relevant inferences from the situation at hand.

                    <h1>Components : Problem-solving</h1>
                    <p>
                        In its general form, the AI’s problem-solving ability comprises data, where the solution needs to find x. AI witnesses a considerable variety of problems being addressed in the platform. The different methods of ‘Problem-solving’ count for essential artificial intelligence components that divide the queries into special and general purposes. <br>
                        In the situation of a  special-purpose method, the solution to a given problem is tailor-made, often exploiting some of the specific features provided in the case where a suggested problem is embedded. On the other hand, a general-purpose method implies a wide variety of vivid issues. Further, the problem-solving component in AI allows the programs to include step-by-step reduction of difference, given between any goal state and current state.

                <div class='Perception'>
                    <h1>Components : Perception</h1>
                    <p>
                        In using the ‘perception’ component of Artificial Intelligence, the element scans any given environment by using different sense-organs, either artificial or real. Further, the processes are maintained internally and allow the perceiver to analyze other scenes in suggested objects and understand their relationship and features. This analysis is often complicated as one, and similar items might pose considerable amounts of different appearances over different occasions, depending on the view of the suggested angle.<br>
                        At its current state, perception is one of those components of artificial intelligence that can propel self-driving cars at moderate speeds.  FREDDY was one of the robots at its earliest stage to use perception to recognize different objects and assemble different artifacts.

                    <h1>Components : Language-understanding</h1>
                    <p>
                        In simpler terms, language can be defined as a set of different system signs that justify their means using convention. Occurring as one of the widely used artificial intelligence components, language understanding uses distinctive types of language over different forms of natural meaning, exemplified overstatements.<br>
                        One of the essential characteristics of languages is humans’ English, allowing us to differentiate between different objects. Similarly, AI is developed in a manner that it can easily understand the most commonly used human language, English. This way, the platform allows the computers to understand the different computer programs executed over them easily.
